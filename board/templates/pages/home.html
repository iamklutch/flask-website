            I build things for the web and occasionally work with mobile apps.

            I spent 21 years in the United States Air Force as a communications nerd.
            Currently I am working on creating this website as well as some web apps for it.
            Check out some of my <a href="{{ url_for('pages.projects') }}">projects</a>
